        <field name="sample_processing_protocol">Protein-data: Stable expression of FLAG-tagged SUMO-2 wild-type in HeLa cells, light/heavy (Exp1) and light/medium/heavy (Exp2) SILAC labeling of the cells, optional MMS treatment of the cells (one SILAC label only), purification by FLAG-IP to enrich SUMOylated proteins, size-separation by SDS-PAGE, in-gel trypsin digestion, LC-MS/MS. Analysis by Velos (Exp1) and Q-Exactive (Exp2). Site-data: Stable expression of His10-tagged SUMO-2-K0-Q87R in HeLa cells, label-free, optional MMS treatment of the cells, purification by His-pulldown, sample concentration and removal of free SUMO by kDa filtering, digestion with Lys-C, purification by His-pulldown, sample concentration and removal of unrelated peptides by kDa filtering, in-solution trypsin digestion, LC-MS/MS. Analysis by Q-Exactive.</field>
        <field name="data_processing_protocol">Protein-data: MaxQuant 1.2.2.9 was used. Search parameters were essentially left at default. Light/heavy SILAC labeling was used for Exp1, and Light/medium/heavy labeling was used for Exp2. Site-data: MaxQuant 1.5.1.2 was used. Search parameters were essentially left at default. QQTGG and pyro-QQTGG were searched as variable modifications, including a list of diagnostic peaks corresponding to unique mass fragments resulting from fragmentation of the QQTGG or pyro-QQTGG tryptic remnant.</field>
        <field name="project_description">Small Ubiquitin-like Modifiers play critical roles in the DNA Damage Response (DDR). To increase our understanding of SUMOylation in the mammalian DDR, we employed a quantitative proteomics approach to identify dynamically regulated SUMO-2 conjugates and modification sites upon treatment with the DNA damaging agent MMS. We have uncovered a dynamic set of 20 upregulated and 33 downregulated SUMO-2 conjugates, and 755 SUMO-2 sites, of which 362 were dynamic in response to MMS. In contrast to yeast, where a response is centered on homologous recombination, we identified dynamically SUMOylated interaction networks of chromatin modifiers, transcription factors, DNA repair factors and nuclear body components. SUMOylated chromatin modifiers include JARID1B/KDM5B, JARID1C/KDM5C, p300, CBP, PARP1, SetDB1 and MBD1. Whereas SUMOylated JARID1B was ubiquitylated by the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase RNF4 and degraded by the proteasome in response to DNA damage, JARID1C was SUMOylated and recruited to the chromatin to demethylate histone H3K4.</field>
